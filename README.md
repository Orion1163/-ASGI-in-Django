# -ASGI-in-Django
Hey there! Welcome to my Django project repository. 🎉

This repository houses my Django web application, where I've learned to deploy a web application using ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface). With this project, I aim to showcase my journey from setting up the development environment to deploying the application on a live server.

# Features:

Deployment with ASGI: Utilizing ASGI, I've deployed my Django application, allowing it to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently.
Daphne Server: I've used Daphne as the ASGI server to serve my Django application, enabling seamless handling of HTTP and WebSockets protocols.
Basic Functionality: The application features a simple welcome message displayed to the user upon accessing the website.
Technologies Used:

1. Python
2. Django
3. Daphne
4. HTML

# How to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Run the Daphne server using the command daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 myproject.asgi:application.
5. Access the deployed application at http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

# Contributions:
I'm open to any suggestions, feedback, or contributions to improve this project further. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. Let's learn and grow together!

Happy Coding! 🚀
